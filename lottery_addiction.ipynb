    "The purpose of this project is to build a mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft. \n",

    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to mitigate the issue. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, our goal is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to our analysis, we found out that the probabilities of winning the lottery are quite low in all three scenarios. Let's now start creating the core functions to discover how we got to such results."

    "In this project, our purpose was to build a mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. A medical institute that aims to prevent such issue wanted to build a dedicated mobile app. We've helped their engineering team by creating the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. Eventually, we managed to answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "We then created functions that gave us the following answers:\n",
    "- There is 1 in 13,983,816 or a 0.000072% chance of winning with a single ticket.\n",
    "- There is a 1 in 13 or a 7.2% chance of winning with a 1,000,000 tickets.\n",
    "- There is a 15.1% chance of having at least 2 winning numbers on a single ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we provided the logic behind the probabilities of winning at the lottery, we're realistically expecting players to keep on playing. However, the reasoning and logic by numbers might help persuade the less addicted players to avoid being drawn into full addiction. Whereas it might be harder for the app to be effective for the truly addicted players, whom might not be persuaded that easily. "
