    "The purpose of this project is to look for a way to win Jeopardy. Jeopardy is a popular TV show based in the US where players answer questions to win money. We'll be working with a Jeopardy dataset to discover useful patterns in the questions that can help us win. More specifically, we'll try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"How often can an answer be used for a question?\"\n",
    "- \"How often are questions repeated?\"\n",
    "- \"Are high-value questions more useful than low-value questions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we did not find any statistically significant relationship among the variables we have investigated. Here are the answers that we found to the abovementioned questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only 5.7% of questions have their answers in the questions asked, which means that we cannot win trying to discover the answers of questions using the question itself.\n",
    "- Questions are repeated 87% of the time. Although we're only looking at a small set of questions, this finding means that it might be worth investigating repeated questions further.\n",
    "- No statistically significant difference was found between high value and low value rows. Moreover, the frequencies are all lower than 5, so the chi-squared test is not as valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we came to the conclusion that further analysis is needed to find more relevant correlations. "

    "In this project, we looked for a way to win Jeopardy by analysing a Jeopardy dataset. We've tried to discover useful patterns by answering to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"How often can an answer be used for a question?\"\n",
    "- \"How often are questions repeated?\"\n",
    "- \"Are high-value questions more useful to win than low-value questions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we did not find any statistically significant relationship among the variables we have investigated. Here are the answers that we found to the abovementioned questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only 5.7% of questions have their answers in the questions asked, which means that we cannot win trying to discover the answers of questions using the question itself.\n",
    "- Questions are repeated 87% of the time. Although we're only looking at a small set of questions, this finding means that it might be worth investigating repeated questions further.\n",
    "- No statistically significant difference was found between high value and low value rows. Moreover, the frequencies are all lower than 5, so the chi-squared test is not as valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, further analysis is needed to find more relevant correlations. We think that further analysis might be needed to find more significant correlations. For example, we could find a better way to eleiminate non-informative words than just removing words that are less than `6` characters long. This strategy could be achieved by manually creating a list of words to remove (g.e., `the`, `than`, etc.), or remove words that occur in more than a certain percentage (g.e., `5%`) of questions. "
